An app to help students connect with event hosts to reduce both waste of food and hunger of students. There are two main flows-one for students ("Get Food") and one for providers ("Give Food"). 

Give Food allows providers to create an event (after filling out appropriate fields) and view attendence.

Get Food allows students to find food, by filtering food by options such as category (ex: fast food) and distance. Students can also set up a notification system to let them know when food becomes available.

We had to hard-code in data for 15 events, and we require addresses to be complete and valid.

We had to prioritized putting a map of where the event was over information on distance of an event from the user.
